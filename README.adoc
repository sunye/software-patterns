== Launching the presentation locally

- Clone the project, cd into it and install https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-revealjs/[Asciidoctor Reveal.js] 
using https://bundler.io[Bundler]:

[source,sh]
----
git clone https://gitlab.univ-nantes.fr/naomod/patters.git 
cd patterns
bundle install
----

- Run `compile.sh` that will:
  * clone reveal.js and
  * compile all Asciidoc sources.

- Start a web server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080 or ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8080 -b 127.0.0.1 or even better with https://github.com/tapio/live-server  to have live-reload each time files are modified.

- Open http://localhost:8080/demo which should show the stereopticon demo.

_Optional: if working in a VSCode environment, use the https://github.com/wk-j/vscode-save-and-run[Save and Run] extension to automatically run `compile.sh` after each SCSS file change. Combined with https://github.com/tapio/live-server[live server] this is amazing._
