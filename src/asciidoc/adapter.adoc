= _Adapter_

Gamma et al. 95


== Intent

* An *adapter* converts the interface from one class to another in accordance with the client's expectations.


== Motivation

* How can a class be reused that does not have an interface that a client requires?
* How can classes that have incompatible interfaces work together?
* How to provide an alternative interface for a class?

== Motivation Example

== Structure of the _object adapter_ pattern

== Consequences

* Respects the _Single Responsibility Principle_ and the _Open/Closed Principle_
* _Increases the overall complexity of the code_

[.notes]
--
* _Single Responsibility Principle_. You can separate the interface or data conversion code from the primary business logic of the program.
* _Open/Closed Principle_. You can introduce new types of adapters into the program without breaking the existing client code, as long as they work with the adapters through the client interface.
* _The overall complexity of the code increases_ because you need to introduce a set of new interfaces and classes. Sometimes it’s simpler just to change the service class so that it matches the rest of your code.

== _Class_ and _object_ adapters

There are two main variants of the adapter pattern:

* The *object adapter* uses a _reference_ to the class that gets adapted, which means at runtime that there is one adapter object and one adaptee object.
* The *class adapter* uses an _inheritance_ to the class that gets adapted, which means at runtime that there is a single object.

The previous slides have only presented the most common variant, ie. the _object adapter_.


== Structure of the _class adapter_ pattern

== Implementation tradeoffs

Class and object adapters have different trade-offs.

* A *class adapter*:
* adapts the _Adaptee_ to the _Target_ by committing to a concrete _Adaptee_ class.
 As a consequence, a class adapter won’t work when we want to adapt a class and all its subclasses.
* lets the _Adapter_ override some of the _Adaptee_’s behavior, since _Adapter_ is a subclass of _Adaptee_.
* introduces only one object, and no additional pointer indirection is needed to get to the _Adaptee_.

== Implementation tradeoffs (Cont.)

* An *object adapter*:

* lets a single _Adapter_ work with many *Adaptee*s—that is, the _Adaptee_ itself and all of its subclasses (if any).
 The _Adapter_ can also add functionality to all _Adaptees_ at once.

* makes it harder to override the _Adaptee_ behavior.
 It will require subclassing _Adaptee_ and making _Adapter_ refer to the subclass rather than the _Adaptee_ itself.
