= Broker

Architectural Pattern

Douglass'02


== Intent

* Support a symmetric distribution architecture (as for dynamic load balancing).
* Allow objects to find each other without knowing their locations a priori (at compiling time).

—-

== Solution

* Add a broker as an object repository, such that when servers run, they register with the broker; when clients need to access a server, they request the location of the server from the broker.

—-

== Motivation

* The broker is a more elaborated version of the Proxy pattern, which separates clients and servers.

—-

== Structure

== Consequences

* Server location is only known when connecting to the broker.
* The broker can use a Watchdog to ensure the integrity of the system.
* Good support for symmetric architectures
* Good commercial support with CORBA
