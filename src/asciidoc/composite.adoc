= _Composite_

Gamma et al. 95

== Intent

* Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
* Let clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

== Motivation

* Occasionally, some applications (e.g. graphic editor) need to deal with primitive objects and container objects, i.e., objects containing other objects.
* Clients want to treat identically primitive and container objects.

== Motivation - example

skinparam monochrome true

boundary Client
Client -> "p1:Picture" : display()
"p1:Picture" -> "p2:Picture" : display()
"p2:Picture" -> ":Text" : display()
"p2:Picture" -> "l2:Line" : display()
"p2:Picture" -> "r2:Rectangle" : display()
"p1:Picture" -> "l1:Line" : display()
"p1:Picture" -> "r1Rectangle" : display()

....

== Applicability

.Use the Composite pattern when:
* you want to represent _part-whole_ hierarchies of objects.
* you want clients *to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects*.
** Clients will treat all objects in the composite structure uniformly.


== Structure

== Consequences

* Clients treat equally composite or atomic structures.
* Clients are simplified.
* It is easy to add new components.
* The solution is sometimes too general (composite accepts any component).

Clients are simplified, since they don’t have to deal with 2 different structures.

== Implementation Tradeoffs

* *Explicit reference to the parent*: sometimes the _Component_ may need to know the _Composite_ that contains it (if any).
* *Sharing components*: sometimes a _Component_ may be possessed by multiple _Composites_ − can influence the behavior or the destruction of _Composites_.

== Implementation Tradeoffs (Cont.)

* *Where to define operations to add/remove components?*:

* Possible error if not called on a _Composite_.

class "/Component" as component {
    add(Component)
    remove(Component)

.In the _Composite_ class?
* Need to type check beforehand.

skinparam monochrome true

class "/Component" as component
class "/Composite" as composite {
    add(Component)
    remove(Component)
}
class "/Leaf" as leaf

component <|-- composite
component <|-- leaf
composite o-- "*" component
....

== Implementation Tradeoffs (Cont.)

* *The Composite may contain a _cache_* to store information on the sum of components it contains.

.Composite as property cache

object "__photo:File__" as photo {
    size = 90
}

object "__scan:Folder__" as scan {
    size = 40
}

object "__card:File__" as card {
    size = 40
