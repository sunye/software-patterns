= _Composite_

Gamma et al. 95

== Intent

* Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
* Let clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

== Motivation

* Occasionally, some applications (e.g. graphic editor) need to deal with primitive objects and container objects, i.e., objects containing other objects.
* Clients want to treat identically primitive and container objects.

== Applicability

* Use the Composite pattern when:
* you want to represent _part-whole_ hierarchies of objects.
* you want clients *to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects*. Clients will treat all objects in the composite structure uniformly.


== Structure

'''

== Consequences

* Clients treat equally composite or atomic structures.
* Clients are simplified.
* It is easy to add new components.
* The solution is sometimes too general (composite accepts any component).

[.notes]
--
Clients are simplified, since they don’t have to deal with 2 different structures.

== Implementation Tradeoffs

* *Explicit reference to the parent*: sometimes the _Component_ may need to know the _Composite_ that contains it (if any).
* *Sharing components*: sometimes a _Component_ may be possessed by multiple _Composites_ − can influence the behavior or the destruction of _Composites_.
* *Where to define operations to add/remove components?*:
* _Component_ class? Possible error if not called on a _Composite_.
* _Composite_ class? Need to type check beforehand.
* *The Composite may contain a _cache_* to store information on the sum of components it contains.
