= _Iterator_

Gamma et al. 95

== Intent

[quote]
____
Provide a way to traverse a collection of elements without exposing its underlying representation: array, linked list, tree, etc.
____


== Motivation

* An aggregate object should give you a way to access its elements without exposing its internal structure.

== Motivation (Cont.)

* The collection structure should be independent from the way it is traversed.

== Solution

* Move the collection traversal behavior into a separate class called _Iterator_.
* All iterators should provide the same interface for accessing and traversing elements, regardless of the class of the collection object and the kind of traversal that is performed.

.The Iterator Interface
[plantuml, cd-iterator, png, align=center, width=400px]
....
scale 400 width
skinparam monochrome true
hide circle

class "/Iterator" as iterator {
   hasMore(): Boolean
   next()
}
....

[.notes]
--
* Iterator class defines an interface for accessing elements
* It is responsible for keeping track of the current element
* Generalize the iterator concept to support polymorphic iteration by generalizing iterators into an abstract iterator class that defines the common iteration interface
--

== Structure

[plantuml, cd-iterator-structure, png, align=center, width=800px]
....
scale 800 width
skinparam monochrome true
hide circle

class "/Client" as client

class "/Iterator" as iterator {
   /hasMore(): Boolean
   /next()
}


class "/Aggregate" as aggregate {
   /iterator(): Iterator
}


class "/ConcreteAggregate" as concreteAggregate {}


class "/ConcreteIterator" as concreteIterator {}

iterator <|-- concreteIterator
aggregate <|-- concreteAggregate

client --> iterator
client --> aggregate
aggregate .> iterator : "creates"

....

== Participants

Iterator:: defines an interface for accessing and traversing elements

ConcreteIterator:: implements the _Iterator_ interface and 
keeps track of the current position in the traversal of the aggregate

Aggregate:: defines an interface for creating an _Iterator_ object

ConcreteAggregate:: creates and returns an instance of the proper _ConcreteIterator_

== Consequences

* It supports variations in the traversal of an _Aggregate_: you can use different ways of iterating by defining various concrete subclasses of _Iterator_ for your collection.
* _Iterators_ simplify the _Aggregate_ interface
* More than one traversal can be pending on an _Aggregate_

== Usage

* _Iterators_ are widely used in the Java Collection Framework (JFC)!

.Iterator.java
[source,java]
----
public interface Iterator<E> {
    boolean hasNext();
    E next();
    default void remove() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("remove");
    }
    default void forEachRemaining(Consumer<? super E> action) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(action);
        while (hasNext())
            action.accept(next());
    }
----

== Usage (Cont.)

.ListIterator.java
[source,java]
----
public interface ListIterator<E> extends Iterator<E> {
    boolean hasNext();
    E next();
    boolean hasPrevious();
    E previous();
    int nextIndex();
    int previousIndex();
    void remove();
    void set(E e);
    void add(E e);
}

== Implementation Tradeoffs

== Who Controls the Iteration? 

- If it's the client: **External Iterator**
- It it's the iterator: **Internal Iterator**

[source,java]
----
// External:
Iterator it = list.iterator(); 
while (iterator.hasNext())
   System.out.println(it.next());
// Internal:
list.stream().forEach(System.out::println);
----

== External e Internal Iterators

.External iterators
* more flexible: easy to compare two collections for equality  

.Internal iterators
* hard to implement on languages without anonymous functions or closures
* easier to use


== Who defines the Traversal Algorithm? 

.The Aggregator
* The _Iterator_ only stores the state of the iteration (it's called a cursor)
* The _Client_ invokes the `next()` operation on the _Aggregate_, with the cursor as an argument
* The `next()` operation changes the state of the cursor

.The Iterator
* Easy to use different iteration algorithms on the same _Aggregate_
* Maybe easier to reuse the same algorithm on different _Aggregates_
* The _Iterator_ might need to access the private variables of the _Aggregate_, 
violating the encapsulation of the _Aggregate_.

== How robust is the iterator? 

[.block]
What happens if the _Aggregate_ is modified when an _Iterator_ is traversing it?

.Robust Iterators:
* ensures that insertions and removals won't interfere with traversal, without copying the _Aggregate_
* in most implementations, robust _Iterators_ are registered with the _Aggregate_:
** on changes, the _Aggregate_ adjusts its _Iterators_

== Robust Iterators in Java

* Java Collections have a modification counter, called `modCount`
* The counter is incremented after each add or removal
* When created, _Iterators_ copy the counter
* The _Iterator_ compares both counters before each iteration

[plantuml, cd-robust-iterator, png, align=center, width=400px]
....
scale 400 width
skinparam monochrome true
hide circle

object "__coll:Collection__" as coll {
    modCount = 100
}
object "__it1:Iterator__" as it1 {
    modCount = 100
}
object "__it2:Iterator__" as it2 {
    modCount = 100
}
coll -- it1
coll -- it2
....


== Additional Iterator operations. 

Minimal _Iterator_ interface:: `First()`, `Next()`, `IsDone()`, and `CurrentItem()`.

Other useful operations:: `Previous()` and `SkipTo()`

[.notes]
--
* For example, ordered aggregates can have a Previous operation that positions the iterator to the previous element. 
* A SkipTo operation is useful for sorted or indexed collections. SkipTo positions the iterator to an object matching specific criteria.
--

== Iterators may have privileged access. 

In C++:: The _Iterator_ is a *friend* of its _Aggregate_

In Java:: The _Iterator_ is an *inner class* of its _Aggregate_, which implements an external `Interface`.

== Iterators for Composites. 

* It's hard to implement an external _Iterator_ over recursive _Aggregates_,
like the link:./composite.html[Composite] pattern.

* Different traversal algorithms: Preorder, postorder, inorder, and breadth-first

* Sometimes, it's easier to implement an internal _Iterator_, and perform recursive calls (the path is stored in the call stack)

* If the nodes in a Composite have an interface for moving from a node to its siblings, parents, and children:  then a cursor-based _Iterator_ may offer a better alternative. 


== Null Iterators. 

* A  `NullIterator` is always done with traversal: operation `IsDone()` always evaluates to  true.

* `NullIterators` are helpful for handling boundary conditions.

* Useful for tree-structured aggregates.
