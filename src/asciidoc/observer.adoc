= Observer

=== [Gamma et al. 95]

'''

== Intent

* An observer defines a dependency relationship between objects so that, *when the state of an object changes*, all its dependents are automatically _notified and updated_.
'''

== Motivation

* A frequent side effect of partitioning a system into a collection of cooperating classes is the need to *maintain consistency* between interconnected objects.
* We don't want consistency to be achieved by closely linked classes, because this would reduce their reusability
'''

== Motivation Example

'''

== Applicability

* Use the _Observer_ pattern when:
* When a concept has two different and dependent aspects (e.g. interface and business data),
* The encapsulation of these aspects in separate classes allows them to vary and be reused independently.
'''

== Structure

'''

== Consequences

* The _subject_ does not know any detail about its _observers_ (nor their quantity)
* *Unexpected updates*: it is hard to know the actual cost of an update (ie. what happens when `update` is called?)
'''
* New observers can be added without changing the subject nor the other observers.
* _Abstract coupling_ between the subject and the observers:
* The subject is not interested in the observer class,
* A subject and an observer can belong to different levels of a system (see the _Proxy_ pattern).
'''

== Implementation Trade-offs

* The association between the _subject_ and the _observer_ may take many forms: collection, dictionary, etc.
* Observation of more than one _subject_,
* Different ways to trigger the notification (*subject*, customer),
* _Subject destruction management_: should observers be destroyed when the subject is destroyed? or simply notified?
'''
* Different notification protocols:
* Two main possibilities:
** Either *Push* (the _observer_ receive information about the change that occurred and can use it directly)
** Or *Pull* (the _observer_ only knows that something changed, and then needs to discover by itself what changed)
* Observation of certain aspects of the subject (selective notification), ie. possibility to *subscribe* to specific changes in the subject
'''
* Encapsulation of the complex semantics of updating:
* if an operation modifies different subjects, it can be better to notify observers only at the end,
* use a *change manager* (see next slide).
