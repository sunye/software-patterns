= Pipes and Filters

Architectural Pattern

Bushmann 96

== Context

* When processing a data stream, the processing of each step is performed by a filter. Filters are connected by pipes that transfer data.
* The different filter combinations generate different data streams processing.


== Context

* A data stream processing system that is naturally divided into stages.
* We want to combine the steps.
* The steps that are not adjacent do not share information.
* We want the different steps to be performed on different processors.
* The data structure used between the steps is normalized.

== Solution

* Separate the system in _Pipes_ and _Filters_:
* Filters incrementally consume and provide data.
* Filters may be parameterized (e.g., Unix filters).
* The input is a data source (e.g., a file)
* The sequence of filters, from the source down to the output, creates a processing pipeline.

== Consequences

* Intermediary files are no longer needed.
* Filters may be replaced streigwhfordly.
* Filter combining create different results (long term utility).
* If a standard data stream format is used, filters can be developed independently.
* Incremental filters allow parallelism.
