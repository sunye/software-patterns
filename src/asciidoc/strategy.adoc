= _Strategy_

Gamma et al. 95

== Intent

* Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
* Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.


== Context

* Use the strategy pattern when:
* there are many related classes that differ only on their behavior. Strategy provides means to configure a class with different behaviors.
* you need different variants of an algorithm.
* an algorithm uses properties that clients should not access.
* a class defines many behaviors, which appear as multiple conditional statements in its operations.

Use the Strategy pattern when:
- many related classes differ only in their behavior. Strategies provide a way to configure a class with one of many behaviors.
- you need different variants of an algorithm. For example, you might define algorithms reflecting different space/time trade-offs. Strategies can be used when these variants are implemented as a class hierarchy of algorithms [HO87].
- an algorithm uses data that clients shouldn't know about. Use the Strategy pattern to avoid exposing complex, algorithm-specific data structures.
- a class defines many behaviors, and these appear as multiple conditional statements in its operations. Instead of many conditionals, move related conditional branches into their own Strategy class.

== Motivation Example

* A sorted list, with different sort algorithms.
* The sort algorithm may be replaced at runtime.

== Structure

image::strategy-structure.png[align=center]

* Strategy defines an interface for a family of algorithms.
* Each concrete strategy implements a different algorithm
* The context defines the current algorithm and provides property access to algorithms.

== Consequences

* Hierarchies of Strategy classes define a family of algorithms or behaviors for contexts to reuse.
* Provides an alternative to subclassing.
* Eliminates the use of conditional statements
* Provides different implementations of the same behavior.
* A client must understand how Strategies differ before it can select the appropriate one.
* Communication overhead between Strategy and Context.
* Object proliferation.


== Implementation Tradeoffs

* Defining the Strategy and Context interfaces.
* The Strategy and Context interfaces must give a ConcreteStrategy efficient access to any data it needs from a context, and vice versa.
* Strategies as template parameters.
* In C++ templates can be used to configure a class with a strategy.
