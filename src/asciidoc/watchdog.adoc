= Watchdog

Reliability Pattern

Douglass 2002

== Intent

* Ensure that a time-dependent process works correctly.

== Structure

image::watchdog-structure.png[align=center]

== Consequences

* Too simple to be used alone in a critical system.
* Well-suited for detecting time failures and deadlocks.
