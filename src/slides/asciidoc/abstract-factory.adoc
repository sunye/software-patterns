= Abstract Factory

Gamma et al. 95


== Intent

* Provide an interface for creating interrelated object families, without specifying their concrete classes.


== Motivation

* Consider, for instance, an application that runs on different graphic systems (e.g. Motif, Presentation Manager)
* Each graphic element (window, button, etc.) must be created differently, depending on the system used.
* To do this, an abstract class is used to create the graphic elements


== Motivation - example

== Applicability (1/2)

* Use an abstract factory when:
** A system must be independent of how its products are created, composed and represented
** A system must choose one of several product families

== Applicability (2/2)

* Use an abstract factory when:
** The objects of a family must be used together, and we want to reinforce this constraint.
** We want to propose a library of products, without showing their implementation


== Structure

== Consequences

* Clients do not know the implementation classes of the families
* Switching between product groups becomes simple
* The consistency within a product family is enhanced
* It is difficult to add new product families.


== Implementation Tradeoffs

* Factories are _singletons_
* Factories define an interface, which can be implemented by a _prototype_ or by a _factory method_
* Definition of extensible factories
