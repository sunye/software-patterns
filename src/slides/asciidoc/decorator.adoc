Gamma et al. 95

== Intent

* Dynamically add a behavior to an object.
* Propose a flexible alternative to inheritance.

[.notes]
--
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality 
--

== Motivation

* Occasionally, we want to add a behavior only to certain objects of a class.

== Applicability (1/2)

* Use the decorator pattern when you want to:
* add a behavior to an object dynamically and transparently.
* add a behavior that can be removed later.

[.notes]
--
to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently, that is, without affecting other objects.
for responsibilities that can be withdrawn. 
--

== Applicability (2/2)

* Use the decorator pattern when the creation of subclasses is impractical.

[.notes]
--
Sometimes a large number of independent extensions are possible and would produce an explosion of subclasses to support every combination. +
Or a class definition may be hidden or otherwise unavailable for subclassing. 
--

== Structure

image::decorator-structure.png[align=center]

* */Component*: the object we want to add behavior to
* */Decorator*: the object that adds behavior to the component.


== Consequences

* More flexible than inheritance.
* Prevents the creation of complex/heavy classes on the top of a class hierarchy.
* Components and decorators are not identical: comparison may not work as expected.
* Explosion of small objects.

[.notes]
--
- more flexible: one can add twice the same behavior!!!
- Component classes REMAIN small.
--

== Implementation Tradeoffs

* Interface conformance: components and decorators must implement the same interface.
* Omission of the abstract Decorator class.
* Lightweight component classes: since decorators specialize the component, the latter should have the less properties as possible.
