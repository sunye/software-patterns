= _Façade_

Gamma et al. 95

== Intent

* Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
* Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

== Motivation

* Structuring a system into components/subsystems helps reduce complexity.
* A common design goal is to minimize the communication and dependencies between components.
* One way to achieve this goal is to introduce a facade object that provides a single, simplified interface to the more general facilities of a component.

== Example

== Applicability

* Use a façade when you want to:
* provide a simple interface for a component.
* reduce dependency between clients and implementation classes.

== Example

== Consequences

* Client only need to know one class from the whole subsystem.
* Coupling between clients and implementation classes is reduced.
* The Façade alone cannot prevent clients from accessing subsystem implementation classes.


== Implementation Tradeoffs

* Implement the Facade as an abstract class with concrete subclasses for different implementations of a subsystem.
* Use concrete subclasses for different implementations of a subsystem.

== More Examples


== javax.faces.context.FacesContext

* Façade for `LifeCycle`, `ViewHandler`, `NavigationHandler` and many more without that the enduser has to worry about.

== javax.faces.context.ExternalContext

* Façade for `ServletContext`, `HttpSession`, `HttpServletRequest`, `HttpServletResponse`, etc.
