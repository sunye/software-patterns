= Layers

Architectural Pattern

Bushmann 96


== Context

* The system has different levels of abstraction
* Typical flow: requests go down, notifications go back up
* It is possible to define stable interfaces between layers
* Layers may be added or changed over time


== Solution

* Partition the system in layers.
* Start with the lowest level.
* Build higher layers on top.
* Keep the same level of abstraction within a layer.
* No component can spread over two layers.
* Keep lower layers leaner.
* Specify interfaces for each layer.
* Handle errors at lowest layer possible.

== Advantages

* Layers are reusable.
* Standardization of tasks and interfaces
* Only local dependencies between layers
* Programmers and users can ignore other layers
* Different programming teams can handle each layer


== Limitations

* Cascades of changing behavior
* Lower efficiency of data transfer
* Difﬁcult to choose granularity of layers
* Difﬁcult to understand the entire system
