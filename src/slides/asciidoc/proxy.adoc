Gamma et al. 95

== Intent

* Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.


== Motivation

* One reason to control the access to an object is to defer the cost of its creation and initialization
* For instance, in a text editor, images in document are not needed when it is opened and the first page is opened.


== Motivation - Example (1/2)

== Motivation - Example (2/2)

== Solution

* Use a lightweight proxy object, that implements the same interface as the object you want to control.
* Use this proxy object as a substitute for the controlled object. Let it create (and destroy) the other only when needed.

== Structure

== Applicability

* Local representation for a distant object (remote proxy).
* Create expensive objects on demand (virtual proxy).
* Control the access to an object (protection proxy).
* Smart pointers (smart pointers).

== Consequences

* A remote proxy can hide the fact that an object resides in a different address space.
* A virtual proxy can perform optimizations such as creating an object on demand.
* Both protection proxies and smart references allow additional housekeeping tasks when an object is accessed.


== Implementation Tradeoffs

* Operator (->) overload in C++.
* Use of the “doesNotUnderstand” method in Smalltalk.
